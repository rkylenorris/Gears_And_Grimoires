# Revised Ability Names

Instead of using the standard __Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma__, consider these alternative names that evoke __arcane technology, machinery, and mystical engineering__ while maintaining the core mechanics\.

| __Standard Name__ | __Thematic Name__ | __Explanation__ |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
|  __Strength__ | __Might__ | Raw physical power, used for heavy lifting, melee combat, and industrial work\.
| __Dexterity__ | __Reflexes__ | Agility, quick hands, and reaction time—essential for both mechanics and combat\.
| __Constitution__ | __Endurance Core__ | A mix of stamina and internal fortitude, also affecting a character’s resistance to steam\-related overexertion\.|
| __Intelligence__ | __Arcane Logic__ | Book knowledge, engineering skills, and understanding of magic\-mechanical interactions\.|
| __Wisdom__ | __Aether Sense__ | Perception of magical energy, intuition, and the ability to navigate between technology and the arcane\.|
| __Charisma__ | __Presence__ | Social influence, command over others, and the ability to control both people and machines through sheer will\.|

__Example of Thematic Use__

- __Might \(Strength\):__ Used to force open jammed steam valves or overpower a mechanical enemy\.

__Additional Thematic Changes__

Since your world blends __steampunk machinery with arcane magic__, you might also rename __saving throws and skill checks__ to reinforce immersion\.
