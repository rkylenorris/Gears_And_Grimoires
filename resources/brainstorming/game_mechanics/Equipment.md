Equipment

__General Rule of Thumb__

- __Weapons:__ 6–10 types, covering melee, ranged, and special weapons\.
- __Armor:__ 3 tiers \(light, medium, heavy\), plus shields\.
- __Gear & Gadgets:__ 5–7 unique items that fit the setting \(e\.g\., steampunk devices, enchanted tools\)\.
- __Consumables:__ 3–5 types of potions, ammo, or other one\-use items\.

__Weapons \(6–10 choices\)__

Aim for distinct categories that cover different playstyles while avoiding redundant options\.

__Melee Weapons \(4-5\)__

- __Clockwork Saber__ – A refined one-handed blade with a self-adjusting edge\. \(Similar to a rapier\.)
- __Steam\-Hammer__ – A massive, piston-powered warhammer that delivers concussive blows\. \(Heavy, high damage\.)
- __Runeblade__ – A magically inscribed sword that hums with latent energy\. \(Balanced option\.)
- __Gadget Gauntlet__ – A mechanized glove fitted with retractable blades and short\-range shock pulses\. \(Fast attacks\.)
- __Arc-Whip__ – A segmented whip charged with electrical energy\. \(High range, low damage, disables opponents\.)

__Ranged Weapons \(3-4\)__

- __Repeating Crossbow__ – A steam\-driven crossbow that can fire multiple bolts quickly\. \(Rapid fire\.)
- __Hand\-Cranked Arcane Rifle__ – A fusion of mechanical engineering and spellcasting, requiring a charge\-up time but delivering devastating bursts\.
- __Grappling Hook Launcher__ – A multipurpose tool that can be used for mobility and limited combat\.
- __Tesla Pistol__ – A compact firearm that releases electric pulses\. \(Close\-range, ignores armor\.)

__Armor \(3 tiers + shields\)__

Armor should be simple but impactful, reflecting a tradeoff between mobility and protection\.

- __Light Armor – Tinkerer’s Vest__ – Reinforced leather with pockets for tools and gadgets\. \(Agile but low defense\.)
- __Medium Armor – Gear\-Forged Brigandine__ – Metal\-plated reinforced gear suit, offering solid protection without sacrificing mobility\.
- __Heavy Armor – Steamplate__ – A bulky, steam\-powered exosuit with built\-in servos for enhanced strength\. \(Best defense but limits dexterity\.)
- __Shields – Clockwork Aegis__ – A deployable shield with mechanical reinforcements\.

__Gadgets & Tools \(5-7 unique items\)__

These add flair and utility without overwhelming complexity\.

- __Autowinder Gauntlet__ – A wrist\-mounted device with extendable tools for quick mechanical fixes or escape tricks\.
- __Pocket Dynamo__ – A small hand\-cranked generator that can briefly overcharge a weapon or device\.
- __Runic Projector__ – A small device that emits temporary glyphs for protection or utility\.
- __Alchemical Canister__ – A pressurized flask containing either healing mist, flammable gas, or paralyzing fumes\.
- __Steam\-Jet Boots__ – Short bursts of propulsion allow limited dashing or jumping\.
- __Magneto\-Wrench__ – A multi\-tool that can manipulate metal objects at short distances\.

__Consumables \(3-5 types\)__

Simple one\-use items to add resource management\.

- __Mana\-Fused Oil__ – Enhances gear performance for a limited time\.
- __Restoration Ampoule__ – A steampunk\-style potion delivered via auto\-injection\.
- __Flash Powder Capsule__ – Creates a temporary smoke screen for stealth or distraction\.
- __Tesla Charge Cell__ – Provides emergency energy for powered devices\.
- __Alchemy Infused Rations__ – Field rations that provide minor healing over time\.

__Why This Works for Simplicity__

- __Weapons & Armor:__ Each class has at least one viable option without overwhelming choice\.
- __Gadgets:__ Small set of useful tools that add variety but don’t overcomplicate\.
- __Consumables:__ Keeps resource management interesting without micromanagement\.

This setup ensures meaningful player choices without bogging them down in excessive gear tracking\. You can always expand with rarer, more advanced versions of these items later\.
