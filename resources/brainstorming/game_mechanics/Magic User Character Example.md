__Character Example: Kieran Voss, Arcane Engineer__

*A spellcasting inventor who fuses mechanical ingenuity with arcane magic, wielding a unique Clockwork Ledger to shape reality\.*

__Character Sheet__

__Name:__ Kieran Voss  
__Race:__ __Steamforged__ \(Augmented Cyborg\)  
__Class:__ __Arcane Engineer__  
__Background:__ __Steamwright’s Apprentice__  
__Primary Abilities:__ Intelligence \(Magic\), Dexterity \(Crafting\), Constitution \(Resilience\)

__Grimoire: Clockwork Ledger__

- A __mechanical spellbook__ with shifting gears and rotating dials\.
- Allows quick __spell swapping__ mid\-battle, but requires regular maintenance\.
- Can __store up to 5 pages of spells__ at a time\.
- Runs on __Steam Capacitors__, which must be replaced after excessive use\.

__Starting Abilities__

__Feature__

__Effect__

__Spellcycle Mechanism__

Once per turn, Kieran can swap a prepared spell without using an action\.

__Overclocking__

Kieran can amplify a spell’s effect, but risks overloading his Clockwork Ledger\.

__Tinkerer’s Insight__

Gains advantage on Arcane and Engineering checks when working with magical technology\.

__Emergency Discharge__

When hit by an attack, Kieran can force his Ledger to release a pulse of energy, dealing minor damage and pushing enemies back\.

__Spells Inscribed in the Clockwork Ledger *\(5 Pages Available\)*__

1. __Aether Spark__ \(*Level 1*\) – A small bolt of arcane electricity, great for jump\-starting machinery or stunning enemies\. *\(1 Page\)*
2. __Heatwave Blast__ \(*Level 1*\) – Unleashes a burst of heated steam, causing scalding damage\. *\(1 Page\)*
3. __Runic Barrier__ \(*Level 2*\) – Creates a protective arcane shield that absorbs damage\. *\(2 Pages\)*
4. __Chrono Surge__ \(*Level 1*\) – Increases movement speed and reaction time, allowing for extra quick actions\. *\(1 Page\)*

- __Spell Modifications:__ 
	- __Overclocking Heatwave Blast__: If Kieran *overcharges* this spell, it deals extra damage but disables his Ledger for one turn\.
	- __Auto\-Runic Barrier__: Kieran has modified his Ledger to *automatically* flip to this spell and activate it when he takes heavy damage\.

__Combat & Gameplay Example__

__Scenario:__  
Kieran and his team are infiltrating an abandoned factory overtaken by rogue automata\. They trigger a __defense turret__, which locks onto him and fires a barrage of arcane bullets\.

__Turn 1 – Tactical Play__

1. __Chrono Surge__ → Boosts his movement speed to dash behind cover\. *\(1 Page Used\)*
2. __Spellcycle Mechanism__ → He swaps Chrono Surge with Heatwave Blast mid\-turn\.
3. __Heatwave Blast__ → Vents pressurized steam at the turret, overheating its circuits\. *\(1 Page Used\)*
4. __Aether Spark__ → As a quick follow\-up, he sends an energy pulse, disabling the turret\. *\(1 Page Used\)*

__Aftermath:__

- Kieran is __low on spell pages__ and must either __recharge his Ledger__ with a __Steam Capacitor__ or spend time __rewriting__ spells\.
- If he doesn’t __recharge__, he’ll have to fight with only his __mechanical tools__ \(wrenches, pistols, or improvised gadgets\)\.

__Between Encounters: Maintenance & Resource Management__

1. __Rewrite Faded Spells__ → Uses Arcane Ink to re\-inscribe Heatwave Blast and Chrono Surge\.
2. __Replace Steam Capacitor__ → Ensures the Clockwork Ledger remains functional\.
3. __Modify Grimoire__ → Installs a cooling mechanism to reduce Overclocking risk\.

__Why This Works__

- __Encourages strategic spell management__—Kieran must decide which spells to inscribe before each mission\.
- __Adds a resource\-balancing element__—if he overuses his Grimoire, he’s forced to rely on gadgets or melee combat\.
- __The Grimoire affects playstyle__—the __Clockwork Ledger__ lets him swap spells mid\-battle, unlike a traditional spellbook\.
