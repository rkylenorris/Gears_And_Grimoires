# Magic System Overview

__How Grimoires Could Function in Magic Use__

Instead of spells being innate (as in D&D with Sorcerers or innate cantrips\), __magic should be linked directly to a character’s grimoire__—a personal, customizable, and upgradable item\.

__1\. Every Magic User Needs a Grimoire__

- Magic in this world isn’t just “casted” from memory—it’s __channeled__ through specially inscribed books\.
- __No grimoire? No spells\.__ Magic users must have their tome in hand \(or a way to quickly access it\) to perform magic\.

__2\. Grimoires Are Customizable__

- Players __choose or craft__ their grimoire at character creation, selecting from different __starting types__ with unique properties\.
- Later, they can modify, expand, or even create __hybrid spellbooks__ mixing magic and technology\.

__3\. Types of Grimoires__

To keep things interesting, players could choose from different styles of grimoires, each offering unique playstyles\.

__Grimoire Type__

__Effects__

__Runed Codex__

Traditional spellbook with written incantations; can store many spells but must be read aloud\.

__Clockwork Ledger__

A mechanical spellbook with shifting pages and arcane dials; allows quick spell swaps\.

__Spell Gauntlet__

A wrist\-mounted device that projects glowing runes instead of flipping pages; faster casting but fewer spells\.

__Aether\-Infused Tome__

A floating book that hovers near the user, automatically flipping to the right spell when needed\.

__Forged Glyphs__

Instead of a book, spells are stored as engravings on metal plates, inserted into a slot to "activate" spells\.

__Tattooed Manuscript__

The user’s skin is inscribed with magic glyphs, allowing them to cast magic by tracing runes\.

Each type __affects spellcasting speed, flexibility, and limitations\.__ For example:

- A __Runed Codex__ might let you cast more spells but require time to find and read them\.
- A __Spell Gauntlet__ might allow instant casting but limits how many spells you can prepare at a time\.

__4\. Expanding a Grimoire__

Players __upgrade their grimoire__ over time by:

- __Finding lost pages__ from ancient sources\.
- __Absorbing arcane energy__ from magical relics\.
- __Crafting mechanical enhancements__ \(e\.g\., steam-powered page turners, holographic runes\)\.
- __Experimenting with hybrid magic__—combining technology and spells in ways that could backfire or lead to powerful discoveries\.

__5\. Spellcasting Requires Maintenance__

Unlike D&D where spells are prepared daily and forgotten after casting, here:

- Grimoires __store__ magic, but spells must be __recharged__ via special rituals, runes, or energy sources\.
- __Steam\-powered grimoires__ may need mechanical upkeep or special fuel\.
- __Organic grimoires__ \(like tattooed runes\) might fade over time and require re\-inscription\.

__Gameplay Impact & Why This Works__

- __Makes Grimoires feel like powerful artifacts__ rather than just generic books\.
- __Encourages spell variety__ because players aren’t just picking from a static spell list—they’re *building* their spellbook\.
- __Adds a layer of resource management__: *How many spells can I carry? Should I upgrade my grimoire or swap to a different type?*
- __Fits the steampunk theme__ by integrating spellcasting with mechanical enhancements\.

# Magic System for *Gears & Grimoires *Detailed

A unique spellcasting system centered around __Grimoires__, combining traditional spellcasting with steampunk mechanics and resource management\.

__1\. Core Concept: Magic is Tied to Grimoires__

- Every magic user must __have a Grimoire__ to cast spells\.
- Unlike traditional systems, __spells are stored as inscriptions__ and __must be activated__ rather than simply "remembered\."
- Different __Grimoire types__ affect how spells are cast, stored, and recharged\.

__2\. How Casting Works__

__Spell Slots → Inscribed Pages__

- Instead of "memorizing" spells daily (like in D&D\), a spellcaster __writes/engraves a limited number of spells__ into their Grimoire\.
- Each spell __takes up a certain number of pages or inscriptions\.__
- If a Grimoire only holds __6 pages__, the caster might need to choose between:
	- __6 small spells__
	- __3 medium spells__
	- __1 massive spell \+ 1 small spell__
- This forces strategic spell management instead of just memorization\.

__Casting a Spell__

1. The caster __opens their Grimoire__ \(or activates it, depending on its type\)\.
2. They select a spell __inscribed__ in its pages\.
3. They expend __Aether Energy__ \(mana-equivalent\) to power the spell\.
4. Some spells __consume pages__, meaning they must be rewritten before reuse\.

__3\. Grimoire Types & Playstyle Impact__

__Grimoire Type__

__Casting Speed__

__Spell Capacity__

__Special Trait__

__Runed Codex__ \(Traditional\)

Slow

High

Can hold the most spells but takes time to flip through pages\.

__Clockwork Ledger__

Moderate

Medium

A mechanical Grimoire with gears that cycle between prepared spells\.

__Spell Gauntlet__

Fast

Low

Wrist\-mounted; allows near\-instant casting but limits spell variety\.

__Aether\-Infused Tome__

Variable

High

A floating book that *autoflips* to the right spell; sometimes unpredictable\.

__Forged Glyphs__

Instant

Low

Metal plates inserted into a slot to *activate* magic like cartridges\.

__Tattooed Manuscript__

Moderate

Medium

Spell runes are inscribed on the caster’s body and activated by tracing them\.

This system lets players __customize their spellcasting experience__, whether they prefer flexibility, speed, or raw power\.

__4\. Spell Recharge & Maintenance__

Unlike D&D where spells reset daily, *Gears & Grimoires* introduces __spell upkeep__:

- __Some spells fade after use__ and must be rewritten \(for free, but takes time\)\.
- __Some spells require energy sources__ like Arcane Batteries or Steam Capacitors\.
- __Magical Overload__: If a caster overuses their Grimoire, it can overheat, glitch, or temporarily lock them out\.

__Ways to Recharge a Grimoire__

__Recharge Method__

__Effect__

__Arcane Ink__

Rewrites lost pages, restoring faded spells\.

__Steam Capacitor__

For mechanical Grimoires, restores energy for spell activation\.

__Ritual Recharge__

A long rest refuels natural spell energy but doesn't rewrite lost spells\.

__Absorbing Aether Energy__

Some Grimoires can siphon energy from magical artifacts\.

This system __adds an element of resource management__ without overwhelming the player\.

__5\. Special Spell Modifications__

Players can customize spells in creative ways based on their Grimoire type\.

__Example Modifications:__

- __Overclocking__: In a Clockwork Ledger, spells can be boosted at the risk of misfire\.
- __Runic Fusion__: Combining two written spells to create a hybrid effect\.
- __Autocasting Pages__: Aether\-Infused Tomes can automatically react to incoming danger \(e\.g\., casting *Shield* when attacked\)\.

__6\. How Spells Are Learned__

Players don’t *just* gain spells on level\-up—they __must find, buy, or invent new pages__ for their Grimoire\.

__Ways to Learn Spells:__

- __Finding Lost Pages__: Ancient spells hidden in ruins or libraries\.
- __Purchasing Scrolls__: Temporary spells that can be copied into the Grimoire\.
- __Inventing New Magic__: Combining known spells to create something unique\.

This __adds a sense of discovery__ rather than just giving players a fixed spell list\.

__7\. How This Benefits Gameplay__

- __Strategic Spell Management__: Deciding which spells to inscribe and when to recharge\.
- __Customization__: Different Grimoires change how magic feels and plays\.
- __Immersion__: Magic isn’t just "click & cast"—it involves preparation, energy, and *arcane engineering\.*
- __Exploration & Discovery__: Finding new spells is part of the adventure\.
