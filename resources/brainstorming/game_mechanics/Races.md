Races

__Approach for Custom Races__

- __Limit the number__: 4–6 distinct races to keep it simple\.
- __Blend magic and technology__: Each race should reflect how they interact with steampunk advancements and arcane forces\.
- __Distinct traits__: Make sure each race has a few unique abilities that feel different from one another\.
